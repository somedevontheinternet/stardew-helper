'''Wheat''' is a [[Vegetables|vegetable]] [[Crops|crop]] that grows from [[Wheat Seeds]] after 4 days. Wheat is harvested using a [[Scythe]] or [[Golden Scythe]]. Wheat has a 40% chance to also drop [[hay]] when harvested with either Scythe.<ref>See <samp>Crop::harvest</samp> in the game code.</ref>.

In addition to [[Beer]], players have the ability to craft [[Wheat Flour]] from Wheat by using a [[Mill]]. Once placed in the mill, one wheat will make one wheat flour. Wheat flour will appear in the box on the right side of the mill the following morning.

==Crop Growth Calendar==
{{#lst:Crop Growth Calendars|Wheat}}

==Multi-Seasonal Crop==
Wheat may be planted in both Summer and Fall. There is no difference in its behavior in either season.

If a Wheat plant (of any growth stage) is in the ground on the 28th of Summer, it will continue growing on the 1st of Fall as though nothing had changed. [[Fertilizer]] in the ground underneath a Wheat plant on Summer 28 will not disappear on Fall 1.  Fully-grown wheat plants may be left unharvested until the 1st of Fall to prevent fertilizer and tilled soil from disappearing.

==Bundles==
10 Wheat are used in the {{Bundle|fodder||y}}.  In game versions prior to v1.5, all ten Wheat must be the same quality (regular, silver, or gold); however, in v1.5, wheat of all three qualities can be stacked into the bundle slot.

==Tailoring==
Wheat is used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] to create the dyeable [[Tailoring|Crop Tank Top]].
*Male version: [[File:Shirt132.png|24px]]
*Female version: [[File:Shirt133.png|24px]]

It can be used in [[dyeing]], serving as a yellow dye at the dye pots, located in [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

==Quests==
*Wheat may be randomly requested in [[Summer]] at the [[Quests#Help Wanted Quests|"Help Wanted" board]] outside [[Pierre's General Store]] for a reward of {{Price|75}} and 150 [[Friendship]] points.

==Tips==
*Since wheat grows quickly and can drop [[hay]], it may be beneficial to devote some farmland to growing it, even if the main focus of the farm is raising animals.
