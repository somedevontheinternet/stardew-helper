{{TOC right|npt=y}}
:''For an index to the completed artifacts collection, see [[Collections#Artifacts]].''
'''Artifacts''' are items found primarily by digging up [[Artifact Spot]]s, though they can be acquired in other ways. There are 42 artifacts in total, and one of each must be donated to the [[Museum]] to complete its collection. Donating to the [[Museum]] will yield rewards when donation milestones are reached, or when specific artifacts are donated.

==Acquisition==
Artifacts can be acquired in the following ways:
*Using the [[Hoes|Hoe]] on an [[Artifact Spot]]. Different parts of the map will produce different artifacts. Artifact Spots are much more common in [[winter]].
*Using the [[Hoes|Hoe]] on dirt in [[The Mines]] and the [[Skull Cavern]].
*Killing [[Monsters]].
*Solving [[Secret Notes]].
*Breaking open [[Artifact Trove]]s.
*[[Fishing]] for treasure chests.
*Breaking [[Mining#Bone Node|Bone Nodes]].
The table below lists specific locations for each artifact.

==Use==
All artifacts can be used for:
*Donation to the museum
*Gifting to [[Penny]] and the [[Dwarf]] as liked gifts
*[[Tailoring]] at a [[Sewing Machine]]

Some artifacts have other specific uses:
*[[Dwarf Scroll I]], [[Dwarf Scroll II]], [[Dwarf Scroll III]], [[Dried Starfish]], and [[Golden Relic]] may be required for some [[Fish Pond#Quests|Fish Pond quests]].
*[[Ancient Seed]] may be [[Crafting|crafted]] into a plantable [[Ancient Seeds]] pack after one is donated to the museum.
*[[Dinosaur Egg]] may be used to hatch a [[Dinosaur]] in an [[Incubator]] or turned into [[Dinosaur Mayonnaise]].
*Prehistoric or fossilized artifacts may be processed in the [[Bone Mill]] to obtain [[Fertilizer]].
*[[Ancient Doll]] is an option for the {{Bundle|Children's||y}}.
*[[Dwarf Gadget]] is required to craft the [[Farm Computer]].

===Donation===
Donating the following artifacts grant unique rewards:
*Donating an [[Ancient Seed]] rewards the player with an Ancient Seed crafting recipe and 1 Ancient Seeds pack, which can then be planted to harvest [[Ancient Fruit]].
*Donating all four Dwarf Scrolls unlocks the [[Dwarvish Translation Guide]], allowing the ability to speak to the [[Dwarf]] merchant in [[The Mines|the Mines]] and in the [[Volcano Dungeon]].
*Donating the [[Ancient Drum]], along with at least 2 other artifacts, rewards the player with a [[Drum Block]].
*Donating the [[Bone Flute]], along with at least 2 other artifacts, rewards the player with a [[Flute Block]].
*Donating the [[Chicken Statue]], along with at least 4 other artifacts, rewards the player with a [[Chicken Statue (furniture)|Chicken Statue furniture]] item.
*Donating the prehistoric bone pieces rewards the player with the [[Sloth Skeleton]] furniture pieces.
*Donating the [[Rare Disc]] and [[Dwarf Gadget]], along with at least 9 other artifacts, rewards the player with the [['Burnt Offering']] painting.

==Artifacts==
Map regions specified under "Location" are places where the artifact can be found when digging up an [[Artifact Spot]], along with the chance per artifact spot of finding the artifact<ref name="artifact_chance" />.

<ref name="artifact_chance">The contents of an artifact spot are calculated by <samp>GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot</samp>; the primary data source is <samp>ObjectInformation.xnb</samp>. 20% of the time a Lost Book is found (except on the Farm). Otherwise, each artifact is checked sequentially to see whether a random number is less than the chance specified by the input file; the first artifact that succeeds is the one found. One result of this algorithm is that the actual chance of finding a given artifact is smaller than the value in the input file, because it can only be found if the Lost Book check failed and all previous artifacts failed their tests.</ref>
<ref name="artifact_extra">The additional chance for this artifact is season-dependent. The maximum chance is in summer and fall.  In winter, the chance is 50% less; in spring it is 6% less. The chance comes from a secondary input file, <samp>Locations.xnb</samp>, which is only used if all other sources fail.</ref>
<ref name="treasure_artifact">The chance of an artifact appearing in a treasure chest is higher if [[Lost Books]] are not possible, ''e.g.,'' after the Museum's collection is complete.</ref>
