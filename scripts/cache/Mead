'''Mead''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] made from placing [[Honey]] inside a [[Keg]], taking 10 hours. It is also available at the [[Ginger Island#Island South|Ginger Island Resort]] for {{price|800}}. Unlike [[Wine]] and [[Juice]] however, the value of the Mead is '''not''' affected by the type of honey used.  The sell price of Mead is {{price|200}}, and only [[Cask|aging]] or the [[Skills#Farming|Artisan Profession]] can increase it.  Several types of [[Honey#Sell Prices|Flower Honey]] sell for more than Mead, so the player can actually lose money by making Mead.

Mead can also be obtained for free from the bar in the [[Ginger Island#Pirate Cove|Pirate Cove]] by speaking with the bartender while wearing the [[Pirate Hat]], [[Deluxe Pirate Hat]], or [[Eye Patch]]. This can only be done once per night.

When consumed, Mead causes a [[Buffs|Tipsy]] buff that decreases [[Speed]] by 1.

==Aged Values==
Mead can be placed inside a [[Cask]] to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Mead.  

Normal, silver, and gold quality Mead can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an [[Axes|Axe]], [[Hoes|Hoe]], or [[Pickaxes|Pickaxe]].
