The '''Poppy''' is a [[Flowers|flower]] that can be [[Crops|grown]] from [[Poppy Seeds]] in 7 days. Unlike all other flowers, Poppies are a [[Friendship#Universal Hates|universally hated gift]]; [[Penny]], who loves Poppies, is the only exception.

If placed within proper range of a [[Bee House#Range|Bee House]] (5 squares in any cardinal direction), a Poppy will cause [[Honey|Poppy Honey]] to be produced, increasing the honey base value from {{Price|100}} to {{Price|380}}.

Poppies can be purchased from the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{tprice|140}}.
