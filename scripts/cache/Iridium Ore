'''Iridium Ore''' is a [[:Category:Resources|resource]] found in [[Mining#Mining Nodes|Iridium Nodes]], [[Mining#Mining Nodes|Mystic Stones]], [[Magma Geode]]s, and [[Omni Geode]]s. It is also a rare drop from high level [[Monsters]], and can be found in [[Fishing#Treasure Chests|Fishing Treasure Chests]] and [[Random Events#Meteorite|meteorites]] on the farm. It can also be produced in a [[Super Cucumber]] [[Fish Pond]] when the population is at least 9. [[Copper Pan|Panning]] may also occasionally yield Iridium Ore. The [[Statue Of Perfection]] produces 2-8 Iridium Ore per day.

Five Iridium Ore can be traded at the [[Desert Trader]] for one [[Mega Bomb]].

==Locations==
* The [[Traveling Cart]] will occasionally sell it for {{tprice|100}}.
* [[The Mines]]: A fairly reliable source of the ore is through [[Magma Geode|Magma]] and [[Omni Geode]]s on lower mine levels. These can be obtained frequently by mining all rocks on mine levels 115-119. To further enhance geode frequency, choose the [[Mining#Mining Skill|Geologist Profession]] at [[mining]] level 5 and the [[Mining#Mining Skill|Excavator Profession]] at [[mining]] level 10.
* A fallen [[Random Events#Meteorite|meteorite]] on [[The Farm]] will drop 6 Iridium Ore.
* [[Mining#Mining Nodes|Iridium Nodes and Mystic Stones]] can be found in the [[Quarry]].
* [[Skull Cavern]]: The chance to find Iridium Ore increases steadily the further one descends into the Skull Cavern.  [[Stone]] can be bought from the [[Carpenter's Shop]] to craft a [[staircase]]. Staircases can also be bought from the [[Desert Trader]] for 1 [[Jade]] each on [[Days of the Week#Sunday|Sundays]]. Large amounts of staircases or [[Crafting#Bombs|bombs]] can get one deep into Skull Cavern quickly.
* Purple slimes in the [[Skull Cavern]] or a [[Slime Hutch]] have a chance to drop both iridium ore and bars.
* [[Bats|Iridium Bats]] in the [[Skull Cavern]] may drop an [[Iridium Bar]] (0.8% chance) and up to 4 Iridium Ore when slain.
* [[Iridium Crab]]s in the [[Skull Cavern]] may drop up to 3 Iridium Ore when slain.
* A [[Super Cucumber]] [[Fish Pond]] may produce 1-3 Iridium Ore when the population of the pond reaches 9.
* [[Krobus]] sells 1 [[Omni Geode]] each [[Days of the Week#Tuesday|Tuesday]] for {{price|300}} each and [[Oasis|The Oasis]] sells 3 Omni Geodes each [[Days of the Week#Wednesday|Wednesday]] for {{price|1000}} each, which can then be broken by [[Clint]] or with a [[Geode Crusher]].  There is a 5% chance an Omni Geode will contain 1-11 Iridium Ore.
* The [[Statue Of Perfection]], which can be obtained after getting four candles during [[Grandpa#Grandpa's Evaluation|Grandpa's Evaluation]], gives the player 2-8 Iridium Ore per day.

==Smelting==
Iridium Ore can be smelted in a [[Furnace]] to create an [[Iridium Bar]].  The smelting requires 5 iridium ore and 1 [[Coal]] and takes 8 in-game hours.

==Bundles==
1 Iridium Ore is used in {{Bundle|engineers||y}}.
==Tailoring==
Iridium Ore is used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] to create the [[Tailoring|Iridium Energy Shirt]].  [[File:Shirt179.png|24px]] It can be used in [[dyeing]], serving as a purple dye at the dye pots, located in [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

==Notes==
When used with [[Weapons#Slingshot|Slingshots]], Iridium Ore deals more damage to monsters than any other ammunition.

==Quests==
One Iridium Ore may be requested by [[Rainbow Trout]], [[Spook Fish]], [[Super Cucumber]], or [[Void Salmon]] in a [[Fish Pond#Quests|Fish Pond quest]] to increase the capacity of the pond from 7 to 10.

==History==
{{History|1.4|Added use in Crafting, Tailoring, and Fish Pond quests.  Adjusted Iridium Node spawn chance after floor 100 in the Skull Cavern. Can be produced by Fish Ponds.}}
