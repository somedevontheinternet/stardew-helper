'''Roe''' are fish eggs that are produced by [[fish]] in a [[Fish Pond]].

The selling price of Roe depends on the fish's base sell price.  The equation is <samp>30 + (base fish sell price / 2)</samp>, rounded down to the next nearest integer.  The health and energy gained from eating roe are the same for all types of roe, including Sturgeon Roe.

All types of roe can be placed in a [[Preserves Jar]] to create a higher-value [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]]: [[Sturgeon]] Roe creates [[Caviar]]; other roe create fish-specific varieties of [[Aged Roe]].

Roe does not belong to any category and therefore it does not benefit from any Profession. It also cannot be sold to [[Pierre's General Store]], but it can be sold to the [[Fish Shop]] or placed in the [[Shipping|Shipping Bin]]. At the [[Stardew Valley Fair]], Roe is considered uncategorised (trash), and gives 2-3 points for judging.

==Roe Types==
All fish produce roe, except those that cannot be put in [[Fish Pond]]s (''i.e.,'' [[Fish#Legendary Fish|Legendary Fish]]) and the two varieties of Squid (which produce [[Squid Ink]] instead).  As for the two non-fish that can be put in Fish Ponds, [[Sea Urchin]]s produce roe, but [[Coral]] doesn't.

The price and color of each roe is dependent upon the fish. In general, the color matches the [[Dyeing|dye]] color of the fish;<ref name="roe_color" /> [[Sturgeon]] are an exception and have black-colored roe, which is used as a blue dye in Dye Pots. Orange is used for any fish that does not have a dye color, although this is not the same color as the generic Roe image, which is a mix of orange and pink eggs.  Despite the variety of displayed colors, all types of roe create orange dye.
