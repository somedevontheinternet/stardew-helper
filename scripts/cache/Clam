The '''Clam''' is an item that can be caught using a [[Crab Pot]] in any [[Crab Pot#Saltwater|saltwater]] body of water. It can also be [[Foraging|foraged]] from [[The Beach]] or randomly found at the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{tprice|50}}.

Even though all other Crab Pot creatures are considered to be [[fish]], Clams are not. Therefore, they cannot be used in [[Cooking#Recipes|recipes]] that call for any fish, cannot be placed in a [[Fish Pond]], do not benefit from the [[Skills#Fishing|Fisher or Angler professions]], and do not count towards the four fishing [[Fishing#Achievements|achievements]]. They also appear in the [[collections]] tab under [[Collections#Items Shipped|Items Shipped]] instead of the [[Collections#Fish|Fish section]].
