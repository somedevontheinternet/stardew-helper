The '''Blueberry''' is a [[Fruits|fruit]] [[Crops|crop]] that grows from [[Blueberry Seeds]] after 13 days.  A [[Preserves Jar]] can make Blueberries into jelly, and a [[Keg]] can make them into wine, which can then be aged in a [[Cask]]. When sold, blueberry prices benefit from the [[Farming#Farming Skill|Tiller profession]], and its jelly and wine prices benefit from the [[Farming#Farming Skill|Artisan profession]].

==Stages==
Each harvest yields 3 Blueberries, with a 2% chance of more blueberries. You can walk through blueberries.

==Crop Growth Calendar==
{{#lst:Crop Growth Calendars|Blueberry}}

==Fertilizer==
[[Basic Fertilizer]] and [[Quality Fertilizer]] only affect the first berry from every harvest, which means 2 out of 3 berries harvested from each bush are going to be regular quality crops. That makes [[Speed-Gro]] an optimal fertilizer for this crop, as it gives one extra harvest before the Fall (assuming planting on day 1 of the summer), increasing season earnings from Blueberry by 25% compared to at most 6% with [[Quality Fertilizer]].<ref name="qual_price" />

Deluxe Speed-Gro yields the same number of harvests as regular Speed-Gro, usually at a higher cost.  (One exception is purchasing Deluxe Speed-Gro from the [[Oasis]] for {{price|80}} vs. purchasing Speed-Gro from [[Pierre's General Store]] for {{price|100}}.)

==Tailoring==
Blueberry can be used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] to create the dyeable [[Tailoring#Pants|Shorts]].  [[File:Shorts.png|36px]] It can be used in [[dyeing]], serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

==Quests==
Blueberry is not used in any [[quests]].

==Trivia==
On Sundays in [[Summer]], Mayor [[Lewis]] may say "Say, are you growing any blueberries on your farm? I do enjoy a fresh blueberry."  Mayor Lewis does in fact like blueberries as gifts.

==References==
<references>
<ref name="qual_price">For the first berry, the maximum relative increase in berry price when using quality fertilizer is at level 6, where the average berry price without any fertilizer is 56 (50*1.16, see table for [[Fertilizer#Normal Soil|normal soil]]) and the average price with quality fertilizer is 66 (50*131, see table for [[Fertilizer#Soil with Quality Fertilizer|quality fertilizer]]). The average total price (adding in the always-normal-quality second and third berries) is therefore 156 without fertilizer or 166 with quality fertilizer. 166 is 6% larger than 156.</ref>
