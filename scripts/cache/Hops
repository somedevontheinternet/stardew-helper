==Tailoring==
Hops is used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] with [[Cloth]] in the feed to create a dyeable {{name|Shirt159|link=Tailoring{{!}}Shirt and Belt|class=inline}}. It is a green dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the green dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in [[dyeing]].

==Tip==
Hops give the 2nd best experience for leveling up your [[Farming]] skill in a single season (102 to 126 depending on how fast you grow it to maturity). It is only beaten out by a mature [[Ancient Fruit]] crop. A large amount of Hops Starters can be a great way to quickly level up your Farming skill your first summer.

Selling [[Hops Starter]] made from the [[Seed Maker]] can be more profitable than selling the Hops directly, and also potentially generates [[Ancient Seeds]]. Pale Ale and Pickled Hops are more profitable, but the Seed Maker only takes 20 in-game minutes.
