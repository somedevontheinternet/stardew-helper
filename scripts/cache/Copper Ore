'''Copper Ore''' is obtained from copper [[Mining#Mining Nodes|nodes]] with a [[Pickaxes|pickaxe]]. Mining a copper node will yield between 1 and 3 copper ore. The [[Skills#Mining|Miner Profession]] can further increase this.

==Locations==
* [[The Mines]] (Floors 2-39) have a high concentration of [[Mining#Mining Nodes|copper nodes]], relative to other floors. The surrounding regular rocks also have a high probability of dropping a single copper ore.
* Nodes can spawn in the [[Quarry]], the [[Quarry Mine]], or in the quarry on the [[Farm Maps|Hill-top and Four-Corners Farm Maps]]
* Can be found in breakable crates and barrels in [[The Mines]]
* Can be bought at the [[Blacksmith]] for {{price|75}} each in year 1 and for {{price|150}} each in year 2+
* Can be found on any floor of the [[Skull Cavern]]
* Can be dropped by [[Metal Head]]s on floors 80-119 of [[The Mines]]
* Can be dropped by [[Slimes|Copper Slimes]] in the [[Quarry Mine]] or random dungeon floors in [[The Mines]]
* Can be found in [[Fishing#Treasure Chests|Fishing Treasure Chests]]
* Can be found by digging up an [[Artifact Spot]] (at [[Pelican Town]], [[Railroad]], [[Bus Stop]], [[Backwoods]], [[Cindersap Forest]], or [[the Mountain]]s)
* Can be found by [[Hoes|tilling]] soil in [[The Mines]]
* Can be found inside any of the 4 types of [[Minerals#Geodes|Geode]]
* Can be found by [[Copper Pan|panning]]
* Occasionally sold by the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{tprice|5}}
* A [[Stonefish]] [[Fish Pond]] may produce 5 Copper Ore when the population reaches 3.
