'''Cheese''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] made from the [[Cheese Press]], taking 3.3 hours. Using [[Milk]] will produce normal quality Cheese, while [[Large Milk]] will produce gold quality Cheese. The [[Desert Trader]] will trade one [[Emerald]] for one Cheese on Fridays.

==Aged Values==
Cheese can be placed inside a [[Cask]] to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Cheese.  

Normal, silver, and gold quality Cheese can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an [[Axes|Axe]], [[Hoes|Hoe]], or [[Pickaxes|Pickaxe]].
