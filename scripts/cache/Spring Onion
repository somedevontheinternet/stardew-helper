The '''Spring Onion''' is a [[Foraging|foraged]] item found in [[Spring]] in [[Cindersap Forest]], but only on the southeast island (''i.e.,'' north of [[the Sewers]] entrance).  Unlike other foraged items, spring onions are respawned daily: all unharvested onions are removed at the end of each day, and new onions appear. The [[Livin' Off The Land]] [[Television]] channel airs a tip about Spring Onions on day 4. Spring Onions may randomly appear in the [[Traveling Cart]]'s stock for {{tprice|8}}.

Harvesting a Spring Onion grants the player 3 Foraging XP. Only one onion can be harvested per plant; the [[Skills#Foraging|Gatherer]] profession does not apply to spring onions.

Once the player has earned 8 hearts of [[friendship]] with [[Jas]] and [[Vincent]], [[Spring Onion Mastery]] can be obtained, which permanently increases the sell price of Spring Onions by 5&times;.
