'''Refined Quartz''' is created by smelting 1 [[Quartz]] in a furnace with 1 coal for fuel. 1 [[Fire Quartz]] can also be placed in a furnace with 1 coal to produce 3 Refined Quartz.  

It can be sold for {{price|50}}. Until obtaining the [[Crystalarium]] it is a lot faster and easier to obtain Refined Quartz via the [[Recycling Machine]] than from quartz itself.

==Locations==

* Can be created by smelting 1 [[Quartz]] in a [[furnace]] with 1 [[Coal]]. Smelting takes 1.5 in-game hours.
* Can be created by smelting 1 [[Fire Quartz]] in a [[furnace]] with 1 [[Coal]] (produces 3 Refined Quartz). 
* Can be created by [[Recycling Machine|recycling]] a [[Broken CD]] or [[Broken Glasses]]
* Can occasionally be found in [[Garbage Can]]s after receiving the [[Furnace]] blueprints from [[Clint]]
* Can be a rare drop from [[Ghost]]s in [[The Mines]] (Floors 51-79)
* Can be dropped by [[Carbon Ghost]]s in the [[Skull Cavern]] (10% chance)
* Can be produced by [[Ghostfish]] [[Fish Pond]]s when the population reaches 9.
