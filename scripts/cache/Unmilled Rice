'''Unmilled Rice''' is a [[Vegetables|vegetable]] [[Crops|crop]] that grows from [[Rice Shoot]]s  after 8 days (6 when irrigated). Unmilled Rice is harvested using a [[Scythe]].

Players have the ability to craft [[Rice]] from Unmilled Rice by using a [[Mill]]. Once placed in the Mill, one Unmilled Rice will make one [[Rice]]. Rice will appear in the box on the right side of the Mill the following morning.

==Stages==
When harvested, each Rice Shoot gives one Unmilled Rice, with a 10% chance of one or more extra rice (0.11 more rice on average).<ref name="extra_rice">The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.1, then another Unmilled Rice will spawn. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.1, at which point the chance for an extra Unmilled Rice ends. This, on average, will give 0.11 extra Unmilled Rice. Keep in mind that [[Luck]] can also double the amount of extra Unmilled Rice spawned by the above formula.</ref>

[[File:Shirt159.png|24px]] It can be used in [[dyeing]], serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

==Quests==
*Unmilled Rice may be randomly requested in [[Spring]] at the [[Quests#Help Wanted Quests|"Help Wanted" board]] outside [[Pierre's General Store]] for a reward of {{Price|90}} and 150 [[Friendship]] points.

==Notes==
*If grown from [[Rice Shoot]]s purchased from [[Pierre's General Store|Pierre's]], it is only profitable to sell gold quality Unmilled Rice directly. With the [[Skills#Farming|Tiller Profession]], silver quality Unmilled Rice becomes profitable by {{price|1}}.  In all cases it is profitable to process Unmilled Rice into [[Rice]] using a [[Mill]], or [[Jellies and Pickles|Pickles]] using a [[Preserves Jar]].
*The day you harvest an Unmilled Rice from an irrigated tile, the tile retains the irrigation water. Anything you plant there that same day will not need watering.
