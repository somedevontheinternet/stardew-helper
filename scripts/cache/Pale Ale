'''Pale Ale''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] made from the [[Keg]] using [[Hops]], taking 1-2 days. It is also available at the [[Ginger Island#Island South|Ginger Island Resort]] for {{price|1000}}. It has the second highest profit per day of any crop used in the [[Keg]] (after [[Starfruit]], 12 &times; base [[Hops]] value) and takes less time compared to other crops (tied with [[Wheat]]). When consumed, Pale Ale causes a [[Buffs|Tipsy]] buff that decreases [[Speed]] by 1.

==Aged Values==
Pale Ale can be placed inside a [[Cask]] to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Pale Ale.  

Normal, silver, and gold quality Pale Ale can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an [[Axes|Axe]], [[Hoes|Hoe]], or [[Pickaxes|Pickaxe]].
