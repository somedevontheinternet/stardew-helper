The '''Sweet Gem Berry''' is a [[Crops|crop]] that grows from a [[Rare Seed]] after 24 days. It is not considered a [[Fruits|Fruit]] or [[Vegetables|Vegetable]] and cannot be used in a [[Keg]] or [[Preserves Jar]], nor does it benefit from the [[Farming#Farming Skill|Tiller profession]].

[[Rare Seed]]s can be purchased from the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{price|1000}} in Spring &amp; Summer, or for {{tprice|200}} in any season. A [[Seed Maker]] can also produce Rare Seeds from a Sweet Gem Berry.

Despite its high value, the berry is regarded as a [[Friendship#Universal Neutrals|neutral gift]] by all the NPCs in [[Stardew Valley]]. When given to [[Old Master Cannoli]] in the [[Secret Woods]], however, the player receives a [[Stardrop]] in return. In [[multiplayer]], all players receive a Stardrop with the gift of a single berry.
