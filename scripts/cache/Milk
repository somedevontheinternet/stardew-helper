'''Milk''' is an [[:Category:Animal Products|animal product]] obtained from a [[Cow]] by using a [[Milk Pail]].  It can also be obtained from [[Sandy]] at random, who will comment that the player looks thirsty.

When a cow has a sufficient [[Animals#Friendship|friendship and mood]] level, it can produce a [[Large Milk]], which is more valuable.
