'''Maple Syrup''' is [[Trees|Tree]] sap made from the [[Tapper]] when it is placed on a [[Maple Tree]], taking {{duration|9 days|class=inline}}.

Maple Syrup can be obtained by tapping [[Maple Tree]]s growing on [[The Farm]] or growing naturally in Stardew Valley (''e.g.,'' in [[Cindersap Forest]]). It can also rarely be obtained after processing [[Hardwood]] in a [[Wood Chipper]].

Although Maple Syrup is labeled "Artisan Good" in-game, it does not benefit from the [[Skills#Farming|Artisan Profession]], but instead from the [[Skills#Foraging|Tapper Profession]] (+25% sell price).
