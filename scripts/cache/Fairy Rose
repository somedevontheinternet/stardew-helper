The '''Fairy Rose''' is a [[Flowers|flower]] that can be [[Crops|grown]] from [[Fairy Seeds]] in 12 days. 

If grown within proper range of a [[Bee House#Range|Bee House]] (5 squares in any cardinal direction), a Fairy Rose will cause [[Honey|Fairy Rose Honey]] to be produced, increasing the honey base value from {{Price|100}} to {{Price|680}}. This is the most valuable type of honey, compensating for the poor profit margins on the flower itself.

Fairy Roses can be purchased from the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{tprice|290}}.
