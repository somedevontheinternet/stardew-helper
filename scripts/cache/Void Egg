The '''Void Egg''' is an [[:Category:Animal Products|animal product]] obtained from a [[Void Chicken]].  Initially, a Void Egg can be obtained through a [[Random Events#The Witch|random event]] involving a witch.  The random event can occur as long as [[The Player|the player]] owns a [[Coop|Big or Deluxe Coop]] that is not full. The witch will fly over the coop during the night and leave a Void Egg inside.

A Void Egg can also be purchased from [[Krobus]] for {{Price|5000}}.  If the player is married to [[Shane]], there is a chance he may present them with one as a gift on rainy days.  A [[Void Salmon]] [[Fish Pond]] may produce a Void Egg when the population of the pond reaches 9.

A Void Egg sells for a base of {{Price|65}}. This is {{Price|15}} more than a Small [[Egg]], but {{Price|30}} less than a [[Large Egg]].

A Void Egg can hatch a [[Void Chicken]] by placing it in a Big or Deluxe Coop's [[incubator]].

A Void Egg will be produced by a Void Chicken daily if fed on the prior day, like all other chickens.
