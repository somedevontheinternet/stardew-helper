'''Cranberries''' are a [[Fruits|fruit]] [[Crops|crop]] that grows from [[Cranberry Seeds]] after 7 days, and keeps producing fruit every 5 days after maturity. 

==Stages==
When harvested, each Cranberry plant gives 2 Cranberries every 5 days, with a 10% chance of one or more extra cranberries (0.11 more cranberries on average).<ref name="extra_cranberries">The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.1, then another Cranberry will spawn. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.1, at which point the chance for an extra Cranberry ends. This, on average, will give 0.11 extra Cranberries. Keep in mind that [[Luck]] can also double the amount of extra Cranberries spawned by the above formula.</ref>

==Crop Growth Calendar==
{{#lst:Crop Growth Calendars|Cranberries}}

===Number of Harvests===
Most [[fertilizer]]s have limited effect on multiple-harvest crops, including Cranberries. Basic and Quality Fertilizers affect only the first berry from each harvest, and Speed-Gro fertilizers do not decrease the time between harvests. As shown in the comparison above, while Deluxe Speed-Gro (&#8776;0.25%) will drop the initial growth time from 7 to 5.25 days, the amount of yields per season after that point is still 4. Retaining soil may potentially be useful to reduce watering.

==Tailoring==
Cranberries can be used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] to create the dyeable [[Tailoring#Pants|Farmer Pants]].  [[File:Farmer Pants.png|36px]] It can be also used as a red dye color at the dye pots in [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

==Quests==
Cranberries are not used in any [[quests]].

==Tips==
*The second day appearance can be deceiving as it looks almost identical to the dead crop sprite, without the brown color.
*Selling [[Cranberry Seeds]] made from the [[Seed Maker]] can be more profitable than selling the cranberries directly, and also potentially generates [[Ancient Seeds]]. Cranberry wine and jelly are more profitable, but the Seed Maker only takes 20 in-game minutes.
