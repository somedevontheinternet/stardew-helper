==Tailoring==
Tulip can be used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] to create the dyeable [[Tailoring#Pants|Skirt]]. [[File:Skirt.png|36px]]  It can also be used as a red dye in the dye pots, located at [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

==Notes==
*Tulips have an equal chance of being one of five different colors.  Tulips of different colors will occupy different slots in inventory or chests.  Five colors &times; four [[Crops#Crop Quality|quality]] levels = 20 possible spaces used.

*Due to its relatively small profit margin, it may be better to grow Tulips for aesthetic purposes or to use as gifts than for profit.
*Their cheap price, short growing period and reasonable energy restoration rate makes them surprisingly useful as early-game energy source.
