==Tailoring==
Tomato is used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] to create the [[Tailoring|Tomato Shirt]].  [[File:Shirt282.png|24px]]  It can also be used as a red dye in the dye pots, located at [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

The Tomato Shirt is seemingly a Mix Between [[Robin]] and [[Demetrius|Demetrius']] shirts, with the left side being Robin and the right side being Demetrius.

==Quests==
The Tomato may be randomly requested in [[Summer]] at the [[Quests#Help Wanted Quests|"Help Wanted" board]] outside [[Pierre's General Store]] for a reward of {{Price|180}} and 150 [[Friendship]] points.

==Trivia==
The ambiguous status of the tomato - fruit or vegetable - is the subject of [[Demetrius]]' Six Hearts event.
