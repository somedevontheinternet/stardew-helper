The '''Salmonberry''' is a [[Foraging#Foraged Items|foraged]] [[Fruits|fruit]] found on bushes in Stardew Valley during Salmonberry Season ([[Spring]] 15-18).  Bushes can be shaken to knock berries loose by using the [[Controls|''Check'' action]]. It won't be found in the wild outside those days.  It can be found at any time (randomly) in [[The Cave|the Farm Cave]] if the fruit bat option is chosen.

Salmonberry has the lowest sell value of any foraged item, making it one of the few fruits that is worth more as a [[Jellies and Pickles|Jelly]] than a [[Wine]]. With [[Bear's Knowledge]], processing Salmonberries into Wine may even result in a loss of money. 

==Details==
The number of berries obtained from each salmonberry bush increases as the player's [[Foraging#Foraging Skill|Foraging Skill]] increases.  At Level 4, two berries will be harvested from each bush instead of one.  At Level 8, three berries will be harvested from each bush.  If Foraging Skill is temporarily increased to 12 or more with a Foraging [[Buffs|Buff]] (by consuming [[Cooking|food]]), then 4 berries will be harvested from each bush.

Salmonberries harvested from bushes never grant any Foraging XP.

With the [[Skills#Foraging|Botanist]] profession all Salmonberries, from all sources, will be iridium quality.  Otherwise, berries shaken from bushes will always be regular quality, regardless of Foraging skill.  Therefore, the only source of silver and gold quality salmonberries is [[The Cave|the Farm Cave]].

Even though Salmonberries are a foraged fruit, they benefit from the +10% [[Skills#Farming|Tiller]] profession price bonus, but the bonus is too small to have an effect unless the player also has the Botanist profession (iridium quality) or [[Bear's Knowledge]]. The only exception is Salmonberries found in the Farm Cave, which do not receive the Tiller bonus unless they are combined in a stack with bush Salmonberries (see [[Fruits#Tiller Profession Details|the fruit page]] for details.)

==Tips==
*While the game suggests gathering Salmonberries to get extra cash, its low sell value also makes it a cheap source of energy and health, and an inexpensive gift to those who like it. Salmonberries can be especially valuable in year 1, when energy resources and gift options are limited. Raising Foraging to level 4 in the first two weeks of the game may yield a total harvest of over 400 salmonberries during harvest time (over 10,000 supplemental energy).
*Each bush has a 20% chance to spawn salmonberries on the overnight update. This increases to 50% on a reloaded save, meaning quitting and reloading the game will net an average of 2.5x more berries. Reloads will always generate identical spawns and will not change even if the game is reloaded again.
