{{For|a detailed analysis of profit using the Keg|Keg Productivity}}
'''Juice''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] made from the [[Keg]], taking approximately 4 [[Day Cycle|days]]. Its selling price is the base value of the [[Vegetables|vegetable]] input multiplied by 2.25 (3.15 with the [[Skills#Farming|Artisan]] profession).

The [[energy]] and [[health]] gains of Juice are the same no matter what vegetable is used to make it.

Although [[Wheat]], [[Hops]], and [[Tea Leaves]] are classified as [[vegetables]], when used with a [[Keg]], they produce [[Beer]], [[Pale Ale]], and [[Green Tea]] respectively.

Juice cannot be put in a [[cask]].
