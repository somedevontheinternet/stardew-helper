The '''Snow Yam''' is a [[foraging]] item found only in [[Winter]]. Wild snow yams do not grow above ground, but instead they are buried in the snow/dirt and must be dug up with a [[Hoes|Hoe]] (no other tools, even [[Crafting#Bombs|Bombs]], will work).

The highest chance of finding a Snow Yam (11-16%, map-dependent) is when digging up an [[Artifact Spot]].<ref name="artifact_chance" />  There is also a 4% chance of finding a Snow Yam when digging standard tillable soil in any exterior location.<ref name="soil_chance" />  Exceptions are in the [[The Farm|Farm]], where Snow Yams can be found at artifact spots, but not standard tillable soil, and in [[the Desert]], where Snow Yams can not be found at all.  Digging up a Snow Yam provides no experience.

Snow Yams can also be grown from [[Winter Seeds]], in which case they are a standard wild-seed crop: they grow above ground, can be harvested without using a tool, give 7 Foraging XP each, and are affected by the [[Skills#Foraging|Gatherer]] and [[Skills#Foraging|Botanist]] professions.

<ref name="artifact_chance">The chance of appearing in an artifact spot is calculated by <samp>GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot</samp>.  The base chance in code is 20% (0.5*0.4), but the actual chance is lower because artifacts and lost books are checked first and must all fail their checks.</ref>
