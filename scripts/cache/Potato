[[File:Shirt159.png|24px]] It can be used in [[dyeing]], serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

==Notes==
<references>
<ref name="extraluck">The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.2, then another Potato will spawn. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.2, at which point the chance for an extra Potato ends. This, on average, will give 0.25 extra Potatoes. Keep in mind that Daily Luck can also double the amount of extra Potatoes spawned by the above formula.</ref>
