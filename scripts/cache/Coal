'''Coal''' is a basic [[:Category:Resources|resource]]. It can be obtained in many different ways, primarily from rocks or [[Dust Sprite]]s in [[The Mines]], purchased from [[Clint]] at the [[Blacksmith]] shop, or using a [[Charcoal Kiln]].  It may also be produced by [[Recycling Machine|recycling]] [[trash]] or found in [[Fishing#Treasure Chests|Fishing Treasure Chests]].  A random amount of coal may be found in addition to metal ores by [[Copper Pan|Panning]]. 

Coal is used in some [[crafting]] recipes and is necessary for smelting in a [[furnace]].

==Locations==
* Coal can sometimes be found by mining rocks — both in the mines and anywhere on the map. Both daily [[Luck]] and the [[Mining#Mining Skill|Prospector Profession]] increase the chances of finding coal.
* Coal can be found in mine carts in certain Floors of the mines - follow the mine railways then simply click on the coal-filled cart (Note: this works only once per cart).
* Coal can be found in brown miner's bags lying in certain Floors of the mines. Every bag contains around 6 pieces.  (Again, this works only once per bag.)
* A [[Charcoal Kiln]] can be used to convert 10 [[wood]] into 1 coal
* You can farm coal by killing [[Dust Sprite]]s between Floors 41-79 of the Mines (50% chance of dropping coal).  You can use the elevator to quickly and repeatedly travel between floors ending in 0 or 5.  (This is an easy way to farm [[Iron Ore]] as well.)
** When farming [[Dust Sprite]]s for Coal, it is best to wear a [[Burglar's Ring]] ([[Adventurer's Guild#Monster Eradication Goals|earned]] by killing [[Dust Sprite]]s).
* Red, Purple, and Black [[Slimes]] may drop coal (10% chance). They can be raised in [[Slime Hutch|Slime Hutches]]
* [[Stone Golem]]s, [[Wilderness Golem]]s, [[Metal Head]]s, [[Shadow Brute]]s, and [[Shadow Shaman]]s may drop coal (10% chance).
* Can be found by digging up an [[Artifact Spot]] (at [[Backwoods]], [[the Mountain]]s, or [[the Farm]])
* Coal may occasionally be found by [[Copper Pan|Panning]]
* Coal may occasionally be sold by the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{tprice|15}}.
* Coal can be found inside all 4 types of [[Minerals#Geodes|geodes]].
* If a Fruit tree is struck by lightning, it will produce coal instead of fruit for a few days before returning to normal.
* [[Railroad|Trains]] may randomly drop coal.

Coal purchased at the [[Blacksmith]] costs {{price|150}} during year 1, so it is cheaper in year 1 to buy 10 wood for {{price|100}} from [[Robin]] at the [[Carpenter's Shop]] and convert that wood into coal in the [[Charcoal Kiln]]. After year 1, wood pricing increases to {{price|50}} per piece but coal increases to only {{price|250}}, so it is cheaper to purchase coal directly.
