The '''Fiddlehead Fern''' is a [[Vegetables|vegetable]] that can be found:
*[[Foraging]] in the [[Secret Woods]] during [[Summer]] (78%).
*Foraging in the [[Skull Cavern#Prehistoric Floors|Prehistoric floors]] of the [[Skull Cavern]].
*Foraging on levels 41-69 of [[the Mines]] while the [[The Mines#Shrine of Challenge|Shrine of Challenge]] is active.
*Foraging in the [[Ginger Island#Island East|Ginger Island jungle]] in all [[seasons]].
*Occasionally at the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{tprice|90}}.

The Fiddlehead Fern is the only foraged item categorized as a vegetable. Being a vegetable, its sell price benefits from the [[Skills#Farming|Tiller]] 10% bonus and it can be turned into [[Jellies and Pickles|Pickles]] or [[Juice]] using a [[Preserves Jar]] or [[Keg]]. But it also receives several [[Foraging]]-related benefits, because it is obtained by foraging.  Specifically, 7 Foraging XP is granted per fern and it benefits from the [[Skills#Foraging|Gatherer]] double-harvest bonus and [[Skills#Foraging|Botanist]] iridium-quality bonus.
