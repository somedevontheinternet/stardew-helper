The '''Nautilus Shell''' is found via [[foraging]] at [[The Beach]] in [[Winter]]. The player may randomly receive one in the mail from [[Demetrius]]. It can also be received as a gift at the [[Feast of the Winter Star]]. It may also spawn on the [[Farm Maps#Beach|Beach Farm]] during any season. It may also be found foraging on levels 1-69 of [[the Mines]] while the [[The Mines#Shrine of Challenge|Shrine of Challenge]] is active.

Several [[Crab Pot]] [[fish]] may produce a Nautilus Shell in a [[Fish Pond]] when the population of the pond reaches 9.
