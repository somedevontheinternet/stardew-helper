The '''Mango''' is a [[Fruits|fruit]] grown by planting a [[Mango Sapling]], waiting 28 days for it to grow into a [[Mango Tree]], and harvesting the tree.  When planted on [[Ginger Island]], a Mango Tree will produce fruit year-round.  In Stardew Valley, a Mango Tree will produce fruit in Summer. 

The [[Island Trader]] exchanges one [['Volcano' Photo]] for 5 Mangoes on [[Days of the Week#Thursday|Thursdays]].
