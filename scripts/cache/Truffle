The '''Truffle''' is a type of mushroom that can only be spawned by a [[Pig]] on [[The Farm]] when the pig is outside the [[Barn]]. Since pigs do not go out of the barn in winter, they spawn no truffles in that season.  Truffles sell for a base price of {{Price|625}}.

Despite being spawned by pigs, truffles are not considered to be animal produce, like eggs or milk. They do not receive a price increase from the [[Farming#Farming Skill|Rancher]] profession.

Despite being mushrooms, Truffles technically are also not considered to be [[Foraging|foraged]] items, but give Foraging XP when picked up on the farm. They are not among the items included in the foraging category at the [[Stardew Valley Fair]], nor are they labeled as "Forage" in [[inventory]]. They do, however, benefit from the [[Skills#Foraging|Gatherer]] and [[Skills#Foraging|Botanist]] professions.

Truffles not gathered on the 28th day of a season disappear on the following morning, the 1st day of the new season.

On rare occasions, a Truffle can be purchased from the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{tprice|625}}.
