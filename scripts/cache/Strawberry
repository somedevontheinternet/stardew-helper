'''Planting on Day of Egg Festival'''

Planting a lot of strawberries can be difficult during the evening after the Egg Festival concludes. The best strategy involves land preparation before the festival. Tilling, fertilizing, and watering can all be completed separately, hours prior to planting.

==Recipes==

==Tailoring==
Strawberry can be used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] to create the dyeable [[Tailoring#Pants|Farmer Pants]].  [[File:Farmer Pants.png|36px]]  It can also be used as a red dye in the dye pots, located at [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

==Quests==
Strawberry is not used in any [[quests]].

==Trivia==
*It is possible to get three harvests from strawberry plants during Spring of year 1. This requires using [[Speed-Gro]] and planting on Spring 13, and the easiest way to do this is to complete the [[Bundles#Spring Crops Bundle|spring crops bundle]]; this requires planting cauliflower on Spring 1 as well as visiting the [[Community Center]] after the [[Egg Festival]] before planting the strawberries. The other way to acquire Speed-Gro by Spring 13 is to craft it, but this requires achieving level 3 [[foraging]] by Spring 6 to acquire [[Pine Tar]] in time, which is more difficult.

==History==
{{History|1.4|Removed from [[Summer]] help wanted [[quests]].  Can now be used in [[Tailoring]].}}
{{History|1.5|Iridium quality is now possible when using [[Deluxe Fertilizer]].}}
