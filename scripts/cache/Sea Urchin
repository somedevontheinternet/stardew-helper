The '''Sea Urchin''' is a [[Foraging|forageable]] item found year-round in the [[The Beach#Tide Pools|Tide Pool]] section of [[the Beach]], ''i.e.,'' to the east of the wooden footbridge<ref name="location" />.  During [[Summer]] 12-14 extra Sea Urchins appear anywhere on the beach (including possibly the western section).

The average spawn rate for Sea Urchin in the tide pool section of the beach is 0.23/day. An additional 0.8 (on average) Sea Urchins per day will spawn during Summer 12-14.  These spawn rates are not affected by the presence of other forageable items on the beach; in particular, Sea Urchins are not part of the standard six item per map limit on forageable items. 7 [[Foraging]] XP are granted for every Sea Urchin picked up, and all Foraging bonuses apply to Sea Urchins.

[[Emily]] may occasionally send you a Sea Urchin in the mail as a gift.  All saltwater [[Crab Pot]] [[fish]] may also produce a Sea Urchin in a [[Fish Pond]], when the population of the pond reaches 5.
