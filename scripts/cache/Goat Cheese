'''Goat Cheese''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] made by placing [[Goat Milk]] in a [[Cheese Press]] (takes 3.3 hours). Using Goat Milk will produce normal quality Goat Cheese, while [[Large Goat Milk]] will produce gold quality Goat Cheese.

==Aged Values==
Goat Cheese can be placed inside a [[Cask]] to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Goat Cheese.  

Normal, silver, and gold quality Goat Cheese can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an [[Axes|Axe]], [[Hoes|Hoe]], or [[Pickaxes|Pickaxe]].
