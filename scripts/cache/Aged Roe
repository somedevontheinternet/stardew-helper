'''Aged Roe''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] made from the [[Preserves Jar]] using any type of [[Roe]] except [[Sturgeon]] Roe. The sell price is twice the unprocessed [[Roe]] sell price.  The health and energy gained from eating Aged Roe is the same for all types of Aged Roe.

Using Sturgeon Roe in a Preserves Jar produces [[Caviar]] instead of Aged Roe.
