The '''Rabbit's Foot''' is an [[:Category:Animal Products|animal product]] obtained from a [[Rabbit]] with sufficient [[Animals#Animal Care|friendship]], [[Animals#Animal Care|mood]], and [[Luck|daily luck]]. It can also occasionally be purchased from the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{tprice|565}} or dropped by [[Serpent]]s in the [[Skull Cavern]] (0.8% chance).

Despite the description, [[Luck#Luck Buffs|Luck buffs]] do not influence the chances of getting a rabbit's foot, nor does carrying a rabbit's foot increase luck.
