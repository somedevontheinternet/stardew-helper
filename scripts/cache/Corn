==Crop Growth Calendar==
{{#lst:Crop Growth Calendars|Corn}}

==Multi-Seasonal Crop==
Corn may be planted in both [[Summer]] and [[Fall]]. There is no difference in its behavior in either season.

If a Corn plant (of any growth stage) is in the ground on the 28th of Summer, it will continue growing on the 1st of Fall as though nothing had changed. Fertilizer in the ground underneath a Corn plant on Summer 28 will not disappear on Fall 1.

==Tailoring==
Corn is used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] with [[Cloth]] in the feed to create a dyeable {{name|Shirt128|link=Tailoring{{!}}Striped Shirt|class=inline}}. It is a yellow dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the yellow dye pot at [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]] for use in [[dyeing]].

==Quests==
*Corn may be randomly requested in [[Fall]] at the [[Quests#Help Wanted Quests|"Help Wanted" board]] outside [[Pierre's General Store]] for a reward of {{Price|150}} and 150 [[Friendship]] points.

==Trivia==
*Normal quality Corn sells for {{price|50}}, but 2 packets of [[Corn Seeds]] sell for a total of {{price|150}}. This is the same sell price as corn pickles (assuming no [[Skills#Farming|Artisan Profession]]), but instead of 4000 minutes in a [[Preserves Jar]], it takes 20 minutes in a [[Seed Maker]].

==History==
{{History|1.4|Fixed bug that caused multi-harvest plants to sometimes survive into Winter 1. Corn can now be used in [[Tailoring]].}}
{{History|1.5|Iridium quality is now possible when using [[Deluxe Fertilizer]].}}
