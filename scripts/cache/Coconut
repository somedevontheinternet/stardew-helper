The '''Coconut''' is an inedible [[Foraging#Foraged Items|Foraged]] [[Fruits|Fruit]] found in the [[The Desert|Calico Desert]] and by shaking palm trees on [[Ginger Island]].  It can also be bought at the [[Oasis]] on Mondays for {{price|400}} or may randomly appear in the [[Traveling Cart]]'s stock for {{tprice|100}}. [[Sandy]] may also send one in the mail as a gift.

Although it is inedible, it may be put in a [[Preserves Jar]] to make Coconut Jelly, or in a [[Keg]] to make Coconut Wine. Coconuts cannot be planted to create [[Palm Tree|Palm Trees]].

The [[Island Trader]] will trade 1 [[Golden Coconut]] for 10 Coconuts, provided the player already previously found at least one Golden Coconut.

==Tailoring==
Coconut is used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] with [[Cloth]] in the feed to create a {{name|Shirt204|link=Tailoring{{!}}Vacation Shirt|class=inline}}. It is a dark brown dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the orange dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in [[dyeing]].

==Quests==
*[[Gus]] requests a Coconut by mail on the 19th of [[Winter]] (year 2) in the [[Quests#Exotic Spirits|"Exotic Spirits" Quest]].  The reward is {{Price|600}} and 1 [[Friendship]] heart.
*Coconut may be randomly requested after the player has completed the [[Bundles#Vaule|Vault Bundles]] at the [[Quests#Help Wanted Quests|"Help Wanted" board]] outside [[Pierre's General Store]] for a reward of {{Price|300}} and 150 [[Friendship]] points.
*3 Coconuts may be requested by [[Sandfish]] or [[Scorpion Carp]] in a [[Fish Pond#Quests|Fish Pond quest]] to increase the capacity of the pond from 3 to 5.

==Notes==
* Normally, coconuts do not receive the +10% [[Skills#Farming|Tiller]] price bonus because they are obtained by foraging (see [[Fruits#Tiller Profession Details|the Fruit page]] for details). However, coconuts obtained as gifts or purchases do, and therefore sell for {{Price|110}}. If stacked with other normal quality Coconuts, the entire stack will receive the price bonus.
* Botanically, the coconut is classed as a drupe, or stone fruit (other examples of Drupes are cherries and peaches).
