'''Coral''' is a [[Foraging|forageable]] item found year-round in the [[The Beach#Tide Pools|Tide Pool]] section of [[the Beach]], ''i.e.,'' to the east of the wooden footbridge<ref name="location" />.  During [[Summer]] 12-14, extra Coral appears anywhere on the beach (including possibly the western section).

The average spawn rate for Coral in the tide pool section of the beach is 0.93/day. An additional 3.2 (on average) Coral per day will spawn during Summer 12-14.  These spawn rates are not affected by the presence of other forageable items on the beach; in particular, Coral are not part of the standard six item per map limit on forageable items. 7 [[Foraging]] XP are granted for every Coral picked up, and all Foraging bonuses apply to Coral.

Several [[Crab Pot]] [[fish]] may produce 1 Coral in a [[Fish Pond]] when the population of the pond reaches 5.

==Tailoring==
Coral can be used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] to create the dyeable [[Tailoring|Strapped Top]].  [[File:Shirt139.png|24px]] It can be also used as a red dye color at the dye pots in [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

==Fish Pond==
Although Coral is not otherwise considered to be [[fish]], it can be placed in a [[Fish Pond]], where it will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 10 Coral; no quests are necessary to increase the pond capacity. Instead of producing [[Roe]], Coral ponds produce [[Dolomite]] and [[Limestone]], but only once the population reaches 9.
