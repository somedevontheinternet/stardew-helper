The '''Daffodil''' is found via [[foraging]] in the [[Spring]], or grown from [[Spring Seeds]].  Up to ten can also be purchased from [[Pierre]] at the [[Flower Dance]].  Although it is a flower in its description (and in real life), the game classifies it as "Forage" and not "Flower."

==Healing==
The Daffodil is edible, but does not increase [[Energy]] or [[Health]].
