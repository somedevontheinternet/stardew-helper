'''Beer''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] made from the [[Keg]] using [[Wheat]], taking 1-2 days. It is also available at [[The Stardrop Saloon|The Saloon]] for {{price|400}} and the [[Ginger Island#Island South|Ginger Island Resort]] for {{price|500}}.  It can also be received as a gift at the [[Feast of the Winter Star]].

When consumed, Beer causes a [[Buffs|Tipsy Buff]] that decreases [[Speed]] by 1.

==Aged Values==
Beer can be placed inside a [[Cask]] to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Beer.  

Normal, silver, and gold quality Beer can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an [[Axes|Axe]], [[Hoes|Hoe]], or [[Pickaxes|Pickaxe]].
