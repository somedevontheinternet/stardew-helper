'''Cloth''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] made from the [[Loom]] using [[Wool]], taking 4 hours.  It can also be made by recycling a [[Soggy Newspaper]] using the [[Recycling Machine]], or dropped from [[Mummy|Mummies]] when slain.  [[Emily]] may occasionally send you a Cloth in the mail. The [[Desert Trader]] will trade three [[Aquamarine]]s for one cloth on Wednesdays.

Placing quality [[Wool]] into a [[Loom]] gives a chance to produce 2 Cloth.  Silver gives a 10% chance, gold gives a 25% chance, and iridium gives a 50% chance.
