The '''Grape''' is a [[Fruits|fruit]] that is both a [[Foraging|forageable]] item and a standard [[Crops|crop]]:
* In [[Summer]], Grapes are a [[Foraging|forageable]] fruit found that grows wild throughout Stardew Valley or can be grown from [[Summer Seeds]].  Specifically, forageable Grapes can be found at: the [[Backwoods]] (62% of all forageable items at this location); the [[The Mountain|Mountain]] (62%); the [[Bus Stop]] (27%); the [[Railroad]] (27%); or, the [[Farm Maps#Forest|Forest Farm Map]] (25%).
* In [[Fall]], Grapes are a standard crop that takes ten days to grow from a [[Grape Starter]] to maturity; the plants can be re-harvested every three days.

Grapes grown as a crop (in Fall) receive the +10% [[Skills#Farming|Tiller]] profession bonus when sold (as do all crops). However, foraged Grapes in summer do not get the Tiller bonus. If you combine Summer and Fall grapes into the same stack, the entire stack will receive the Tiller bonus (see [[Fruits#Tiller Profession Details|the Fruit page]] for more details).

Other than the Tiller profession bonus, foraged Grapes and crop-grown Grapes are identical and can be used interchangeably in crafting, gifts, bundles, recipes, and quests.

==Stages==
You cannot walk through grape plants grown from a Grape Starter at any stage of growth.  You can walk through dead Grape plants.
