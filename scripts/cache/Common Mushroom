The '''Common Mushroom''' is a mushroom found via [[foraging]] throughout Stardew Valley in the [[Fall]]. They can be found in the [[Secret Woods]] during [[Spring]] and [[Fall]], [[Farm Maps|Forest Farm]] during [[Summer]], and in the [[Ginger Island#Dig Site|Ginger Island mushroom cave]]. They can be grown from [[Fall Seeds|Wild Seeds (Fa)]] or in mushroom bins in the [[The Cave]] if the mushroom option is chosen. They can also be obtained by [[Tapper|tapping]] a [[Mushroom Tree]].  

Putting a Common Mushroom in a [[Seed Maker]] will generate 1-3 [[Fall Seeds]].

==Tailoring==
Common Mushroom is used in the spool of the [[2 Willow Lane#Sewing Machine|Sewing Machine]] to create a [[Tailoring|Shirt]]. [[File:Shirt074.png|24px]] It can be used in [[dyeing]], serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in [[Emily]]'s and [[Haley]]'s house, [[2 Willow Lane]].

This shirt is very likely a reference to the [[wikipedia:Super_Mario|Super Mario]] game series, where the titular character [[wikipedia:Mario|Mario]] commonly eats mushrooms.

==Quests==
