'''Pine Tar''' is a [[Trees|Tree]] sap made from a [[Tapper]] placed on a [[Pine Tree]]. The process takes {{duration|5-6 days|class=inline}}.

Pine Tar can be obtained by tapping [[Pine Tree]]s growing on [[The Farm]] or growing naturally in Stardew Valley (''e.g.,'' in [[Cindersap Forest]], the [[Railroad]], around the [[Carpenter's Shop]]). It can also rarely be obtained after processing [[Hardwood]] in a [[Wood Chipper]].

Although Pine Tar is labeled "Artisan Good" in-game, it does not benefit from the [[Skills#Farming|Artisan Profession]], but instead from the [[Skills#Foraging|Tapper Profession]] (+25% value).
