==Crop Growth Calendar==
{{#lst:Crop Growth Calendars|Sunflower}}

==Multi-Seasonal Crop==
Sunflowers may be planted in both Summer and Fall. There is no difference in their behavior in either season.

If a Sunflower plant (of any growth stage) is in the ground on the 28th of Summer, it will continue growing on the 1st of Fall as though nothing had changed. Fertilizer in the ground underneath a Sunflower plant on Summer 28 will not disappear on Fall 1.
