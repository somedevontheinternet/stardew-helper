The '''Winter Root''' is a [[foraging]] item found only in [[Winter]]. Wild winter roots do not grow above ground, but instead they are buried in the snow/dirt and must be dug up with a [[Hoes|Hoe]] (no other tools, even [[Crafting#Bombs|Bombs]], will work).

The highest chance of finding a Winter Root (17-24%, map-dependent) is when digging up an [[Artifact Spot]].<ref name="artifact_chance" />  There is also a 4% chance of finding a Winter Root when digging standard tillable soil in any exterior location.<ref name="soil_chance" />  Exceptions are in the [[The Farm|Farm]], where Winter Roots can be found at artifact spots, but not standard tillable soil, and both the [[The Desert|Desert]] and [[Ginger Island]], where Winter Roots can not be found at all.  Digging up a Winter Root provides no experience.

Winter Roots can also be grown from [[Winter Seeds]], in which case they are a standard wild-seed crop: they grow above ground, can be harvested without using a tool, give 7 Foraging XP each, and are affected by the [[Skills#Foraging|Gatherer]] and [[Skills#Foraging|Botanist]] professions.

Occasionally they may be sold at the [[Traveling Cart]] or found in [[Garbage Can]]s in [[Winter]].  They may also be dropped by Blue [[Slimes]] (8% chance) in [[The Mines]] (floors 41-79) or [[Secret Woods]].

Putting a Winter Root in a [[Seed Maker]] will generate 1-3 [[Winter Seeds]].
