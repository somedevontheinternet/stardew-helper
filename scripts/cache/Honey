'''Honey''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] produced by the [[Bee House]] every 4 days in every season other than [[Winter]]. It can be purchased from the [[Oasis]] year-round on Fridays for {{price|200}} or at the Traveling Cart for {{tprice|100}}. 

Honey can be made into [[Mead|mead]] by placing it inside a [[Keg|keg]].

==Flower Honey==
Fully-grown flowers planted near the Bee House will have an effect on the type of honey produced, increasing its sale price. Flowers are not used up when a hive produces honey, and multiple hives can make honey from the same flower, so one flower can service a large number of hives. The honey type is determined when harvested, rather than when it becomes ready: If honey is left in a Bee House until a nearby flower has bloomed, it will be harvested as flower honey.

If no flowers are planted near the Bee House, or if a Bee House has produced flower honey, but the flower is harvested before the honey, the honey will become "Wild Honey," the least profitable Honey. Similarly, if a Bee House is removed with a [[Tools|tool]] while it has flower honey ready for harvesting, the honey will go into inventory as "Honey", which is functionally identical to Wild Honey. Honey purchased from the [[Oasis]] or [[Traveling Cart]], or [[Deconstructor|deconstructed]] from a [[Warp Totem: Farm]], is also called "Honey", and is also functionally identical to Wild Honey.

==Sell Prices== 
[[Flowers]] not listed below (''i.e.,'' [[Crocus]] and [[Sweet Pea]]) do not influence the price of honey.  [[Daffodil]] and [[Dandelion]] are classified as "Forage" not "Flower" in-game, so they do not influence the price of honey either.

The formula used to calculate the sale price of honey is <code>base honey sell price + (base flower sell price &times; 2)</code>.<ref name="sellprice" />
