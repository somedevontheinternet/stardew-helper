The '''Rainbow Shell''' is found via [[foraging]] at [[The Beach]] in the Summer. It may also spawn on the [[Farm Maps#Beach|Beach Farm]] during any season. It can also be obtained through the [[Traveling Cart]] or in [[The Mines]] after activating the [[The Mines#Shrine of Challenge|Shrine of Challenge]] or during the [[Quests#Danger In The Deep|Danger In The Deep]] quest. It may also be sent in the mail as a gift from [[Demetrius]] or received as a gift from [[Jas]] or [[Vincent]] at the [[Feast of the Winter Star]]. A [[Rainbow Trout]] [[Fish Pond]] has a 2% chance to produce 1 Rainbow Shell daily when the population of the pond reaches 9.
