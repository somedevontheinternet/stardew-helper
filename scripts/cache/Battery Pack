[[File:Rod lightning.gif|framed|Lightning striking a Rod]]

The '''Battery Pack''' is created in the [[Lightning Rod]] during [[Weather|thunderstorms]] or the [[Solar Panel]] after 7 sunny days. 

To acquire a Battery Pack from a Lightning Rod, during a thunderstorm a particular sound will be heard, which means that one of the rods is now charged, pulsating with energy. There is no guarantee that a specific lightning rod will be struck by lightning during a thunderstorm. On the day after the storm, a Battery Pack can be acquired from it.

Battery Packs can sometimes be purchased from the [[Traveling Cart]] for {{tprice|500}} and can be sold to Robin at the [[Carpenter's Shop]].  Very rarely, a Battery Pack can be dropped by breaking boxes or crates in the [[Skull Cavern]].  They may also be dropped by [[Bats|Iridium Bats]] (5% chance).
[[Kent]] and [[Pam]] may also send the player a Battery Pack in the mail.

Three Battery Packs will be received as a reward for completing the [[Remixed Bundles#Children's Bundle|Children's Bundle]] in the [[Community Center]].
