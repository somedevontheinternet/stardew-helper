'''Wine''' is an [[Artisan Goods|Artisan Good]] made from the [[Keg]], taking 7 days.  It can also be received as a gift at the [[Feast of the Winter Star]].

The sell price of Wine depends on the [[Fruits|fruit]] used (3 &times; Base Fruit Value).  When consumed, wine causes a [[Buffs|Tipsy]] buff that decreases [[Speed]] by 1. The [[energy]] and [[health]] gains of Wine are the same no matter what fruit is used to make it.

'''Note:''' It is possible to acquire Wine that has no base fruit (from the [[Traveling Cart]] or a [[Statue Of Endless Fortune]], as a gift at the [[Feast of the Winter Star]], or a New Year's Eve gift from [[Leah]] or [[Elliott]]). This item is simply titled "Wine", and has a selling price of {{price|400}} (or {{price|560}} with the [[Farming#Farming Skill|Artisan Profession]]).

==Aged Values==
Wine can be placed inside a [[Cask]] to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Wine.  

Wine takes the longest to age of any item in [[Cask]]s. It takes 2 seasons of aging to go from basic wine to iridium quality wine.

Normal, silver, and gold quality Wine can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an [[Axes|Axe]], [[Hoes|Hoe]], or [[Pickaxes|Pickaxe]].
